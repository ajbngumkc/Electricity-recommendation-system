The following code version has three modules
Data enrollment -> clustering -> generating ON/OFF states, predicting target -> Energy dissagregation results
Data preprocessing -> Resampling ->filling null values
Pattern mining -> Apriori algorithm
Evaluation -> Energy consumption -> classification report
